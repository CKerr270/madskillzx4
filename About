* I am an avid hunter, fisherman, and outdoorsman. My favorite season is Fall because it allows me to get outside and do the things I enjoy most. Bass Fishing and Deer season are among my favorites. I also really enjoy going out to corn mazes, pumpkin patches, and everything to do with Halloween.
* I have also been gaming since I was a kid. For now I play on Xbox but i have been slowly transitioning to PC gaming because I beleieve it is a much better platform for gaming and allows me to customize nearly every aspect of my gaming experience.
* My goal with my computer science to degree is to pursure a career in game development. I have always thought it would be amazing to work on some of the larger gaming titles that I, as well as my friends, regularly play. It would be an awesome experience to be able to hop into a game of Rocket League, or Borderlands, or any of the other games I play, and show people the individual aspects of the game that I helped create/maintain.
